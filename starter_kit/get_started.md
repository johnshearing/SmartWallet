To work along on your own, follow the installation instructions found at the following link.  
https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit  

Any behavior we wish to create from Brian's example can be accomplished by making changes to these three files:  
index.html, view.css, and controller.js  
So if you setup the official starter kit linked above and substitute the three files found here for the three in the official repository then you can see my changes and make your own.
